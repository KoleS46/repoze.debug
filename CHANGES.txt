Next release

  - Make debug request id reflect approximate UNIX time rather than a
    random debug id.

  - Deal with responses via a generator; don't unwind response bodies
    into memory.

  - Default max_bodysize is now 3K rather than the entire response
    body.

  - User interface; keep entries around to show in GUI.

0.4 (2008/06/25)

  - Add pdbpm middleware for dropping into the post-mortem debugger
    upon an exception (copied from repoze.errorlog).

0.3 (2008/06/25)

  - Add 'canary' middleware for detecting environment dictionary
    leaks.  Add to your Paste config via 'egg:repoze.debug#canary'; it
    takes no arguments.  If refcounts to repoze.debug.canary.Canary
    grow without bound, you know you are leaking WSGI environment
    dictionaries.

  - Add source url to response logging.

0.2 (2008/06/14)

  - Add warning if content-length != body length.

0.1 (2008/06/13)

  - Initial release.
